"""Smoke test: the version actually installed, against what the artifact asked for.

Runs in the normal suite AND in the release container. It is DECISIVE in the
container, because that is the only place in this pipeline where the published
ranges are the ones in force: the wheel is installed with
`pip install /dist/*.whl` and every dependency comes from PyPI, whereas
everywhere else `tool.uv.sources` substitutes the sibling checkout.

Reads installed metadata rather than pyproject.toml because that metadata is
what consumers actually get — true in both environments. Its sibling
tests/test_dependency_declarations.py reads the source of truth instead, so the
two disagree exactly when a build is stale.

Why this file exists: the container gate already ran and missed opensrm-p3bm.
Resolving from the registry is not the same as checking WHAT it resolved, and
no pre-existing smoke test asserts a version, so a range that is wrong but
satisfiable produced a green container.
